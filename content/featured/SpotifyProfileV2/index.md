A comprehensive web-based bus ticket booking system developed during my 2nd year. It supports secure user authentication, bus search & ticket booking, booking history, and password recovery for passengers.  

The system also includes an administrative dashboard for managing tickets and users. Designed with a responsive front end and backed by Java Servlets, JSP, and MySQL, the platform provides a complete solution for bus reservation workflows.
